# Weight Progress Tracker

## Comments
This is my weight tracker, implemented using React. I was able to include all of the core functionality along with:

● Allowing editing of past weight entries.

● Adding a toggle for users to switch between metric and imperial units.

To stay efficient, I prioritized a functional product rather than optimizing for user experience. However, I'm happy with how it came out. I ran out of time, but if given more, I would have focused on:

● Writing unit tests.

● Including more advanced statistics.

● Changing the UI and generally improving the user experience a bit.

I started with formatting the main page and getting the core components in. After enabling the user to store their weight goals and current weight, I began the "insights" component and calculating statistics. It was important for me to plan out all the data I needed to capture before starting. This helped me save lots of time. Thank you!

## How to View / Run

The app is hosted at https://jcambier.github.io/progress-tracker/, so feel free to look there rather than worry about installing dependencies on your machine.

If the page has gone down or you would like to run the code locally anyways, please follow these steps:

In the project directory, run:

### `npm install`

to install dependencies, then:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

In case there are any problems with this process, I have Node version [`22.18.0`](https://nodejs.org/en/download) downloaded (with the corresponding npm package manager).
